# Jordan-NewWebsite
This is a new website.

This website, UrbanDrive, is an inventory management platform for vehicles. The interface allows users to browse through a catalog of vehicles categorized by type (e.g., Electric, Petrol, Hybrids) and includes details such as Price, Fuel Consumption, and Type of each vehicle. It also features basic navigation links such as Home, Inventory, and Contact, along with a Search bar for filtering results.
HTML Structure:
The main container likely uses a <div> tag to organize the vehicle cards.
Each vehicle card could be represented using individual <div> elements, styled with CSS classes.
Vehicle details (like name, price, fuel type) would be displayed using elements like <h2>, <p>, or <span>.
Navigation bar and category filters are likely structured with <nav> and <button> elements.
CSS for Styling:
CSS is used to define the layout, including grid or flexbox for card alignment, colors, and responsive design.
The background, button styles, and typography seem consistent and modern, suggesting a well-designed stylesheet.
Search and Category Filters:
JavaScript or simple links could be integrated to implement search functionality or filter options, possibly using event listeners for interactivity.
Image Placeholder:
The broken image icons indicate either missing or improperly linked image files (defined in <img> tags).
This combination of HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript forms a robust foundation for such a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
